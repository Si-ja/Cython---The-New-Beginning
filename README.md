# Cython - The New Beginning

You meant python? NO! Cython. I'm sure you have heard of this module, but never tried for yourself. So how about going through some files here and seeing how Cython (C implementation of Python) implemented in the real world starting from the problems such as hello world and going on to something more complicated.

I advise you go through various folders, starting from 0. Basics and focusing on the *_test.py files. They compare implementation of modules and how they work in the python implementation and working backwards from there.

So the idea is simple: I read the documentation, you take a look at the code.
